THIS IS THE ED TEST SUITE

DIRECTIONS:

1) make a copy of and edit exec_test_carver_serial.sh
   This is a bash script that will make a working directory and generate
   a number of execution scripts and such in the working directory.  
   The working directory will be labeled according to the test name you
   choose.

2) execute the script

3) The working directory will now be full of stuff. Check it over.  Make sure the ED2IN files look the way you want them.  Modify these as you see fit.

4) if everything in your working directory looks good, then you are ready to submit the runs to your queueing system.  The script submit_batch.sh will set up all of the queues.  Take at the queue scripts that it calls "batch_xxxx_xxx" and see if they look right.

5) when you simulations are done, drop down below the working directory and edit MATLAB file dev_test.m

6) run the matlab script, if on a cluster, recommend using ./matlab -nodesktop -nosplash.  Another tip: make sure that the system fonts that matlab uses are enable.

7) The matlab script will (hopefully) generte a full report in the working directory: ./report/xxxxx.pdf


matlab -nodisplay -nojvm -nosplash -nodesktop -r "try, run('dev_test.m'), catch, exit(1), end, exit(0);"
echo "matlab exit code: $?"
